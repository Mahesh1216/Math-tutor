              "content": "We are given the inequality $4 \\alpha x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x} \\geq 1$ for all $x>0$. We need to find the least value of $\\alpha$.\nRearranging the inequality, we get $4 \\alpha x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x} - 1 \\geq 0$.\nLet $f(x) = 4 \\alpha x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x}$. We want $f(x) \\geq 1$ for all $x>0$.\nTo find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we can use calculus. Let's find the first derivative and set it to zero.\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (4 \\alpha x^{2} + x^{-1})$\n$f'(x) = 8 \\alpha x - x^{-2}$\nSet $f'(x) = 0$ to find critical points:\n$8 \\alpha x - \\frac{1}{x^2} = 0$\n$8 \\alpha x = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n$8 \\alpha x^3 = 1$\n$x^3 = \\frac{1}{8 \\alpha}$\n$x = \\left(\\frac{1}{8 \\alpha}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{2 \\alpha^{1/3}}$\n\nFor $f(x)$ to have a minimum, the second derivative $f''(x)$ must be positive at this critical point.\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (8 \\alpha x - x^{-2})$\n$f''(x) = 8 \\alpha - (-2)x^{-3}$\n$f''(x) = 8 \\alpha + \\frac{2}{x^3}$\nSince $x>0$ and we are looking for a positive $\\alpha$ (as $4\\alpha x^2$ must be positive to ensure $f(x) \\geq 1$), $f''(x)$ will always be positive at the critical point $x = \\frac{1}{2 \\alpha^{1/3}}$. This confirms it's a minimum.\n\nSubstitute the value of $x$ back into the original inequality $4 \\alpha x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x} \\geq 1$:\n$4 \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\alpha^{1/3}}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2 \\alpha^{1/3}}} \\geq 1$\n$4 \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{4 \\alpha^{2/3}}\\right) + 2 \\alpha^{1/3} \\geq 1$\n$\\frac{4 \\alpha}{4 \\alpha^{2/3}} + 2 \\alpha^{1/3} \\geq 1$\n$\\alpha^{1/3} + 2 \\alpha^{1/3} \\geq 1$\n$3 \\alpha^{1/3} \\geq 1$\n$\\alpha^{1/3} \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$\nCube both sides:\n$(\\alpha^{1/3})^3 \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3$\n$\\alpha \\geq \\frac{1}{27}$\n\nThus, the least value of $\\alpha$ for which the inequality holds is $\\frac{1}{27}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use AM-GM inequality. We need to split $\\frac{1}{x}$ into two parts to match the power of $x^2$. It's better to make the terms $4\\alpha x^2$, $\\frac{1}{2x}$, $\\frac{1}{2x}$. But that is for $3$ terms, and the equality holds when all terms are equal. This leads to issues with the form $4\\alpha x^2 + \\frac{1}{x}$.\nLet's rewrite $4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x}$ as $4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{2x} + \\frac{1}{2x}$.\nBy AM-GM inequality for three positive numbers $a, b, c$, we have $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{abc}$.\nSo, $4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{2x} + \\frac{1}{2x} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{(4 \\alpha x^{2}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2x}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2x}\\right)}$\n$4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4 \\alpha x^2}{4x^2}}$\n$4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha}$\nFor the inequality $4 \\alpha x^{2} + \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 1$ to hold, we must have $3 \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} \\geq 1$ (this is the minimum value).\n$3 \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} \\geq 1$\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$\n$\\alpha \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3$\n$\\alpha \\geq \\frac{1}{27}$\nThe equality holds when $4 \\alpha x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2x}$, which gives $8 \\alpha x^3 = 1$, or $x = \\frac{1}{(8 \\alpha)^{1/3}}$. This is the same critical point found using calculus.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{27}}$"

              "content": "Let the sides of the right-angled triangle be $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, since they are in arithmetic progression. Since it's a right-angled triangle, the longest side must be the hypotenuse, so $a+d$ is the hypotenuse.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem:\n$(a-d)^2 + a^2 = (a+d)^2$\n$a^2 - 2ad + d^2 + a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2$\n$2a^2 - 2ad + d^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2$\n$a^2 - 4ad = 0$\n$a(a - 4d) = 0$\nSince $a$ is a side length, $a \\neq 0$. Therefore, $a - 4d = 0$, which implies $a = 4d$.\n\nNow, substitute $a=4d$ back into the side lengths:\nSmallest side: $a-d = 4d-d = 3d$\nMiddle side: $a = 4d$\nHypotenuse: $a+d = 4d+d = 5d$\nSo the sides are $3d, 4d, 5d$. This is a well-known Pythagorean triplet scaled by $d$.\n\nThe area of a right-angled triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. The two shorter sides are the base and height.\nArea $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times (3d) \\times (4d) = 6d^2$.\n\nWe are given that the area is 24.\nSo, $6d^2 = 24$\n$d^2 = 4$\n$d = 2$ (since $d$ must be positive for the sides to be positive lengths).\n\nThe lengths of the sides are:\nSmallest side: $3d = 3(2) = 6$\nMiddle side: $4d = 4(2) = 8$\nHypotenuse: $5d = 5(2) = 10$\n\nThe question asks for the length of its smallest side.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6}$"
