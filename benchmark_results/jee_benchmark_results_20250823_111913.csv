jee_001,Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - x^2 + 5x - 1,12x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 5,"The derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - x^2 + 5x - 1 is f'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 5. I used the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), for each term in the polynomial. For example, the derivative of 3x^4 is 3 * 4x^(4-1) = 12x^3. The derivative of a constant, like -1, is 0.",guardrails,4.193783760070801,True,0.8,
jee_002,Solve the equation: 2x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0,"x = 1, x = 3","Okay, I can help you with that! Here's how to solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0:
**1. Simplify the equation (optional but helpful):**
Notice that all the coefficients are divisible by 2. Dividing the entire equation by 2 simplifies it:
x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0
**2. Factor the quadratic expression:**
We need to find two numbers that multiply to 3 and add up to -4. Those numbers are -1 and -3.  Therefore, we can factor the equation as:
(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0
**3. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:**
*   x - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1
*   x - 3 = 0  =>  x = 3
**Solution:**
The solutions to the equation 2x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0 are x = 1 and x = 3.  You can verify this by plugging these values back into the original equation.
For example, if x = 1:
2(1)^2 - 8(1) + 6 = 2 - 8 + 6 = 0
And if x = 3:
2(3)^2 - 8(3) + 6 = 18 - 24 + 6 = 0
Therefore, both solutions are correct. Do you have any other equations you'd like me to solve?",guardrails,5.134443283081055,False,0.058823529411764705,

jee_007,Find the limit: lim(x→0) (sin(x)/x),1,"The limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 is a fundamental result in calculus. It's a classic example often used when introducing limits and derivatives. The limit is equal to 1.
lim(x→0) (sin(x)/x) = 1
This result can be shown using several methods, including L'Hôpital's Rule (since direct substitution gives the indeterminate form 0/0) or by using the Squeeze Theorem (also known as the Sandwich Theorem). Geometrically, it can be understood by considering the unit circle and the areas of related triangles and sectors as x approaches 0.

jee_008,Calculate the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2,8/3,"Sure, I can help you with that. The area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 can be calculated using integration.
The definite integral of x^2 from 0 to 2 is:
∫[0 to 2] x^2 dx = [x^3 / 3] evaluated from 0 to 2
= (2^3 / 3) - (0^3 / 3)

Therefore, the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 is 8/3, or approximately 2.67 square units.",guardrails,4.279081583023071,True,0.8,
jee_009,Solve for x: e^(2x) - 3e^x + 2 = 0,"x = 0, x = ln(2)","Okay, let's solve the equation e^(2x) - 3e^x + 2 = 0. Here's how we can approach it:
1.  **Substitution:** Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let  `y = e^x`.  Then, the equation becomes:
`y^2 - 3y + 2 = 0`
2.  **Factoring:** This is a quadratic equation in `y`. We can factor it as follows:
`(y - 1)(y - 2) = 0`
3.  **Solve for y:**  This gives us two possible solutions for `y`:
*   `y - 1 = 0  =>  y = 1`
*   `y - 2 = 0  =>  y = 2`
4.  **Substitute back for x:** Now we need to substitute back `e^x` for `y` and solve for `x`:
*   Case 1: `e^x = 1`
To solve this, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:
`ln(e^x) = ln(1)`
`x = 0`  (Since `ln(1) = 0`)
*   Case 2: `e^x = 2`
Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
`ln(e^x) = ln(2)`
`x = ln(2)`
Therefore, the solutions for x are:
*   `x = 0`
*   `x = ln(2)`
So, the final answer is x = 0 and x = ln(2). Let me know if you'd like me to show the steps in more detail or if you have any other questions!",guardrails,6.399129152297974,False,0.02564102564102564,
jee_010,Find the equation of the tangent line to y = x^3 at x = 2,y = 12x - 16,"To find the equation of the tangent line to y = x^3 at x = 2, we need to find the slope of the tangent line and a point on the line.
First, we find the derivative of y = x^3, which is y' = 3x^2. This derivative gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point x.
Next, we evaluate the derivative at x = 2 to find the slope of the tangent line at that specific point:
y'(2) = 3 * (2^2) = 3 * 4 = 12.
So, the slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is 12.
Now, we need to find the y-coordinate of the point on the curve where x = 2.
y = (2^3) = 8.
So, the point is (2, 8).
Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point, we can write the equation of the tangent line:
y - 8 = 12(x - 2).
Simplifying this equation, we get:
y - 8 = 12x - 24
y = 12x - 24 + 8
y = 12x - 16.
Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to y = x^3 at x = 2 is y = 12x - 16.",guardrails,6.838176012039185,True,0.8,
